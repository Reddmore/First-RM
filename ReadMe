The purpose of this library is to work with a very specific arithmetization with additional assumptions about the field size
Open source and free to use.

This library provides efficient and flexible implementations of various first-RM elliptic curves, originally implementing the RM445 curve with traits from the zkcrypto ecosystem,

Quickstart CUDA/OpenCL codes for blstrs Scalar elements:
Split the work between multiple developers

To get started with RM, you'll need to have some tools and dependencies installed. Here's everything you need:


Self-Managed repack scraper among all the most reliable websites on the Megathread
It only allows circuit with less or equal than 1 instance column and no rotated query to this instance column
Ability to recompile into a dynamic language (such as Lua) to be able to load code at runtime for mod support

Solution: Add memory, knowledge and tools.
Some individuals have repackaged and sold it for profit.

There are several system requirements including clang.

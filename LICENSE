A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

New detail will add soon on 15 july
